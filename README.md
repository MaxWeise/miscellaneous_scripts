# miscellaneous_scripts
This repo is a collection of scripts I write in my free time. There is no guarantee the scripts will be finished (if not allready), as coding these scripts is only for fun and 
to try and learn something new. 

The programs in this repo can range from small games (TicTacToe) to productivity scripts which stem from my need to optimize my workflow (tex_pipeline).
